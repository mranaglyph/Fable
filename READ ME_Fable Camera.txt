General Info:
This .exe was compiled from AutoIt [SciTE-Lite]. As I understand, 
AutoIt had a bad reputation in the past with people abusing it and 
creating malware/trojans.

As a result, some AutoIt created programs can be flagged as a trojan. 
In the case of this .exe [Fable Camera], if this happens, it is a false positive.

This file is really short and sweet as far as the script length is concerned.
I have included the original .au3 file if you want to see.

What It Does:
All this program does is take the key binding for resetting the camera, and
creates a logic gate using the numpad. I'm sure this could be repurposed, 
but I'm not thinking about how yet. Anyway, Enjoy! 

How To Use:
1.  Load your Fable game first.

2.  Go into options and change the key binding for "Reset Camera" to "Num Lock."

3.  Run this program [Fable Camera.exe]

4.  The camera in game will now always be behind the player, which I personally find to be much more 
    visually useful than the "auto-lock when you walk past someone" camera the game gives you normally.

5a. Of course, if you want to disable the camera fix temporarily, you can use the 
    division [/] key on the numpad.

5b. Just press the division [/] key again to re-activate the camera fix. 

6.  Alternatively, F9 should stop the .exe altogether, and you would need to 
    re-run it again if you wanted it back.

TL;DR: 
	F9 = Kill Process
	/ = Toggle Camera Fix On/Off
